## What is this

The beginnings of what I hope is eventually a nightly twitter bot that tweets out the average velocity of that day's MLB starters, along with 3-5 game trailing averages and previous year averages

## To do
[ ] Find API to scrape daily results that has average velo
[ ] Find source for game logs with average velo
[ ] Find source for previous year average velo

[ ] Write nightly scraper
[ ] Make twitter bot
